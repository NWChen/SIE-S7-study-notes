### purchasing annuities
- insurance co.s offer purchasing arrangements for annuities
- aggregate fees:
	- sales charges on frontend
	- sales loads levied on surrender (__conditional deferred sales load__)
- __lump-sum payment__ - investor can make one single payment to insurance co.
	- e.g. __single premium deferred annuity__ - payment of benefits delayed until later date selected by annuitant
	- e.g. __immediate annuity__ - payout commences within 60 days
- __periodic__ (monthly/quarterly/annual) - payment basis
	- e.g. __periodic payment deferred annuity__ - allows investments over time (benefits always deferred until later date)

### bonus annuities
- sometimes offer direct financial benefits
	- enhancement of buyer's premium (in exchange for higher fees/expenses & longer surrender periods)

### sales charges
- no stated maximum sales charges on variable annuities
	- most annuities (fixed or variable) are sold w/ little/no sales charge
- surrender charge (CDSC/CDSL) for early termination

### accumulation phase
- __accumulation phase__ - growth phase of annuity
- __payout phase__ = annuity phase
- contract owner's interest in separate acct is _accumuation units_ or _annuity units_ (depending on contract phase)
	- accumulation units vary in value based on separate acct's performance

> quiz 3.q.
> 1. B
> 2. B
> 3. B (D)

## payout phase
- annuitant can annuitize contract upon receiving payments from the annuity
- once annuitized, money is distribuetd per payout option chosen
- accumulation units purchased over time are converted into fixed number of annuity units
	- helps compute monthly payout during retirement
- annuity units vary in value based on separate acct performance

> accumulation unit values are computed daily on forward pricing basis
> annuity unit values are computed monthly based on actual performance vs. assumed IR

### receiving distributions from annuities
- annuity offers several payment options for money accumulated in acct
	- investor can withdraw funds { randomly | lump sum | annuitize contract (receive monthly income) }
- __annuitization__ payment option: monthly check dependent on
	- amt of $ in contract (more money -> bigger check)
	- age (older age -> bigger check)
	- sex (women live longer than men -> get a smaller check)
	- payout option
	- invstmt return vs. assumed IR for var. annuities

### assumed IR
- if variable annuity, insurance co. determines:
	- initial value for annuity units
	- amt of first mo.'s annuity payment
- at which time __assumed interest rate__ (AIR) is established
	- conservative projection of performance of separate acct over estimated life of contract
- value of annuity, annuitant's subsequent monthly income vary based on:
	- separate acct performance (compared to AIR)
- determining whether monthly payment will { increase | decrease | stay the same } as prev. mo.:
	- separate acct perf > AIR => next mo. payment MORE than this mo.
	- separate acct perf = AIR => next mo. payment EQUALS this mo.
	- separate acct perf < AIR => next mo. payment LESS than this mo.

### surrender
- annuitant can cash in annuity if desired
	- cost base = total amount invested
- annuitant is liable for income tax on growth +10% penalty if age<59.5

### death of annuitant
- if annuitant dies during accumulation period: death benefit takes effect
- beneficiary gtd: `max(total value of annuity, total amt invested)`

### annuitization
- if annuitant wishes to receive scheduled payments _for life_ they may annuitize
- in event of annuitization: annuitant must select payout option:
	- life annuity (straight life/life only), or
	- life annuity w/ period certain, or
	- joint life w/ last survivor annuity, or
	- unit refund option

### life annuity/straight life
- annuitant selects life income option
	- insurance co. pays annuitant for life
- when annutiant dies: no continuing payments to beneficiary
	- money remaining in acct reverts to insurer
- bad choice if annuitant died after receiving only one month's payment
	- in life income option, where all money accumulated not paid out at time of annuitant death would belong to insurer

### life annuity w/ period certain
- less risky options: payments payable to beneficiary
- annuitant gtd monthly income for life
	- if death occurs in period, a named beneficiary receives payments for remainder of period
	- check smaller than straight life option

### joint life with last survivor annuity
- gtd payments over _two lives_:
	- often used for spouses
	- insurance co. obligated to pay check over two lifetimes
- check smaller than life with period certain option

### unit refund option
- min. number of payments made upon retirement
	- if value remains in acct upon annuitant death: value is payable to annuitant's beneficiary in lump sum
- option can be added as rider to one of the others
- __the only lifetime annuitization option guaranteeing all money in contract will be distributed__
- smallest check a person could receive for the rest of her life

### annuities taxation
- all contributions are made with after-tax dollars UNLESS annuity part of qualified retirement plan / held in IRA
- already-taxed dollars are part of investor's cost basis (not taxed when withdrawn)
	- earnings in excess of cost basis are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn

> e.g. investor contributed $100k to variable annuity
> annuity now worth $150k
> investor's cost basis = contributions = $100k
> taxable amount at withdrawal = earnings = $50k
> annuities supplement retirement income, provide tax-deferred growth
> withdrawals at age <59.5 are subject to 10% early withdrawal penalty + ordinary income tax on earnings portion of withdrawal
> when investor chooses to annuitize & selects monthly income payout option, each mo.'s payment is considered partly a return of cost basis & partly earnings
> only earnings portion is taxable
> random withdrawals over annuity option use LIFO taxation (IRS choose tax revenue as early as possible)
> there is no capital gains taxation on annuities/retirement plans
> (only ordinary income tax on annuities distributions and retirement plans)

> quiz 3.r.
> 1. D
> 2. C
> 3. D (C)

## variable annuity suitability
- variable annuities meant to bring supplement income when needed
	- NOT preservation of capital
- SUITABLE FOR SOMEONE WHO:
	- can fund contract with cash (funding an annuity by refinancing a home or withdrawing equity is a terrible idea)
- NOT SUITABLE FOR SOMEONE WHO:
	- needs lump sum of cash invested in variable annuity at a later time (anticipating buying home, paying children's tuition is a terrible idea)
	- wants to invest the VA in a tax-deferred account (e.g. IRA, which is already tax-advantaged) - VA will provide not addtl tax savings, but will increase expense of IRA (vs. stocks/bonds/mutual funds)
	- isn't OK with a risky eq-invested separate acct (VA contracts are insurance co. products investing in a portfolio of sxties via separate acct)

### 1035 exchange
- tax-free exchange between like contracts
- annuity & life-insurance policyhodlers can exchange policies w/o tax liability
- exchange abuse:
	- reg rep emphasizes tax-free nature of exchange w/o pointing out possible disadvantages, e.g.:
		- possible surrender charges on old policy
		- new surrender charge period on new policy
		- possible loss of higher death benefit (on old policy)
- reg rep AND firm principal must believe customer informed of:
	- potential surrender period/surrender charge of VA,
	- potential tax penalty on selling/redeeming deferred VA before age=59.5,
	- mortality/expense fees,
	- invstmt advisory fees,
	- rider charges/features,
	- insurance/invstmt components of deferred VA,
	- mkt risk
- firm must inquire whether cust. exchanged a VA w/ another BD within last 36mo

## life insurance
- provides death benefit to named beneficiary in event of insured's premature death
- designed to last until `min(age 100, death of insured)`
- premium calculated based on policyowner's:
	- health
	- age
	- sex
	- policy face amt at issue
- __whole life insurance__: NOT a sxty, NOT sold as an invstmt

### variable life insurance
- VL insurance - has fixed, scheduled premium
- unlike whole life insurance,
	- premiums paid are _split_:
	- part of premium placed in general assets of insurance co.
- general assets guarantee min death benefit
- premium balance placed in __separate acct__
	- represents cash value of policy
	- thus cash value not gtd (can fluctuate)
- policy's death benefit has a floor at minimum gtd amt (as long as premiums are paid), no ceiling (based on invstmts)
	- premiums above amt necessary to pay for min. death benefit are invested in separate acct
		- separate acct portion subject to invstmt risk, VL insurance (is a sxty)
- subaccount choices:
	- growth,
	- income,
	- balanced,
	- index/indices,
	- money mkt
- since VL insurance policy is sxty and insurance product, prospectus must be delivered before/at time of solicitation

### AIR and variable death benefit
- under VL insurance policy: death benefit payable is adjusted on annual basis
	- varies w/ performance of separate acct (compared with AIR)
- benefits:
	- death benefit may adjust upward (keep pace with inflation) possibly
	- death benefit received by beneficiary free of income tax
- if separate acct returns:
	- eq. AIR => actual earnings = estimated expenses (no charge in death benefit)
	- lt. AIR => contract's death benefit decreases (but has floor @ amt gtd at issue)
- variable death benefit adjusted annually
- AIR:
	- __doesn't affect__ cash value accumulation in VL policy (only separate acct does)
	- __does affect__ death benefit (separate acct performance against AIR = change in the death benefit)

### loans
- VL contract allows insured to borrow against contract's cash value
- restrictions:
	- insured can only borrow pctage of cash value (min pctage of 75% must be made available after policy in force for 3yrs)
- no scheduled repayment of loan
	- if death benefit becomes payable AND loan outstanding:
		- loan amt deducted from death benefit before payment
	- if outstanding loan reduces cash value to negative amt, insured must deposit enough into acct to stay positive within 31days (or face contract termination by insurance co., &loan doens't need to be repaid)

### contract exchange
- in early stage of ownership:
	- policyowner can exchange Vl contract for fixed-benefit WL contract
- contract exchange provision must be available >=24mo (2yrs)
- no evidence of insurability (medical underwriting) needed
- new WL policy will have, wrt minimum gtd in VL contract,:
	- same contract date, and
	- same death benefit, and
	- amt gtd = premiums (as if it were the original contract)

### sales charges
- on fixed-premium VL contract MUST BE <=9% of payments made over life of contract
	- contract life = maximum of 20 years

### refund provisions
- insurer must extend _free-look period_ to policyowner:
	- `max(45days from execution of application, 10 days from time owner receives policy)
- during that period, policyowner:
	- terminate policy AND receive all payments made
- refund provisions extend 2yrs from policy issuance
	- insurer must refund contract's cash value (value after insurer receives redemption notice) PLUS pctage of sales charge deducted
- after 2yr period:
	- insurer must refund cash value, but retains all sales charges

> max sales charge over contract life = 9%
> policyowner wanting refund within 45days receives all money paid
> after VL policy in effect for 2yrs: surrender value of policy = cash value

### suitability of VL insurance
- there must be:
	- life insurance need
	- applicant comfortable w/ separate acct
	- applicant comfortable that cash value NOT gtd
	- applicant must understand variable death benefit feature
	- prospectus delivered prior to/upon solicitation

## education plans
### 529 plans
- __Section 529 plan__ - tax-advantaged savings plan offering benefits to those saving for future education costs
	- generally under auspice of states/agencies
	- technically muni fund sxties
- two types: __prepaid tuition plans__, __college savings plans__
- tax-deferred/after-tax-funded plans
	- withdrawals generally tax-free
- _anyone_ can open a 529 plan for a future student

#### prepaid tuition plans
- donors can lock in future tuition rates at today's pxs (offering inflation protection)

#### college savings plan
- donor can invest lump sum/periodic payments
	- generally goes to target-date funds
	- invstmt risk (of losing money) applies
- up to $10k/yr investable for k-12 tuition purposes
- no age limitations
- no income limitations
- max $15k contribution (after which gift tax applies)
- assets in acct remain property of donor even after beneficiary reaches legal age

> 529s are state-sponsored
> indiv. states have their own version of the plan

### coverdell education savings accts
- _not_ muni sxties
- fundable w/ traditional types of sxties
- ceiling of after-tax contributions of <=$2000/student/yr until 18th bday
- earnings grow tax deferred
- contributions not tax-deductible
- distributions tax-free if taken before age 30/used for education expenses
- if money not used for education by age 30, then ordinary income tax +10% penalty applies (charged to beneficiary)

# 4. Options
## options contract
- 2-party contract where:
	- buyer has right
	- seller has obligation
- standardized by OCC
- exchange-traded on CBOE
- underlier can be:
	- stock
	- stock mkt index
	- foreign ccy
	- interest rate
	- govt bond
- a derivative, since value drived from underlier
	- most common contract: equity option where `1 contract = 100 shares of underlier`

> CBOE also offers mini-options contracts, overlayig 10 (not 100) shares of the underlier
> a mini-option contract premium of 2 represents $20
> vs. a standard contract of 2 premium = $200

## parties involved
- buyer (=long=holder=owner)
	- pays _premium_ - cost of contract - to seller
	- debit to acct of buyer when premium paid
	- buyer opens position w/ debit to acct
	- has rights to exercise (buy/sell underlier)
- seller (=short=writer)
	- receives _premium_ from buyer
	- credit to acct of seller when premium received
	- seller opens position w/ credit to acct
	- has obligation when contract exercised (writer will be assigned - must buy/sell as req'd by contract0

## specifications of an options contract
1. __Underlying instrument__ - anything with fluctuating value
2. __Price__ - a strike or exercise px (SP) at which purchase/sale of underlying sxty occurs
3. __Expiration__ - all contracts have specified life cycle / expire on specified date
	- once issued, contract can be bought/sold any time during life cycle
	- __standard contracts__: issued w/ 9mo expirations, expire on 3rd friday of exp. month @ 11:59pm ET
	- __long-term equity anticipation sxties__ (LEAPS) - maximum expirations of 39mo, but most trade in a 30mo-cycle (customizable at first trade b/w buyer/seller)
	- __weekly contracts__ - issued on Thurs, expire Fri of following week
		- have lower premiums due to shorter time span b/w { issue date -> expiry date }
		- new weeklies listed each week, _except_ wk that standardized contracts expire

### calls
- __long call__ - buy calls; call buyer owns _right to buy_ 100shares of underlier at SP before expiry (if choose to exercise)
- __short call__ - call writer/seller; _obligated to sell_ 100shares of underlier at SP if buyer exercises

### puts
- __long put__ - put buyer owns _right to sell_ 100shares of underlier at SP before expiry (f choose to exercise)
- __short put__ - put writer (seller) _obligated to buy_ 100shares of underlier at SP if buyer exercises

> buyers pay premiums for the _optionality_ of exercising/not exercising
> writers are only exercised against
> buyer wants contract to be exercised (wins; seller loses)
> seller wants contract to expire (keeps premium, w/ no purchase/sale of underlier)
> buyers have __rights__
> sellers have __obligations__

### single option strategies
- buying calls
- writing calls
- buying puts
- writing puts

### calls
> e.g. Long XYZ Jan 60 call at 3
- __Long__ investor bought call & has right to exercise contract
- __XYZ__ contract includes 100shares $XYZ stock
- __Jan__ contract expires on 3rd Friday of _January_ @11:59 ET
- __60__ strike price is 60
- __call__ investor has right to buy stock at $60 (since investor is long call)
- __3__ contract premium = $3/share (contract issued w/ 300 shares, so total premium=$300); investor paid premium to buy the call

> e.g. Short XYZ Jan 60 call at 3
- __Short__ investor sold call & has obligations if contract exercised 
- __XYZ__ contract includes 100shares $XYZ stock
- __Jan__ contract expires on 3rd Friday of _January_ @11:59 ET (if expiration occurs, writer keeps premium w/o obligations)
- __60__ strike price is 60
- __call__ investor obligated to sell stock at $60 if exercised (since investor is short call)
- __3__ contract premium = $3/share ($300 total premium received by investor)

### mkt attitude
- call _buyer_ - bullish (wants mkt to rise); call exercised only if mkt px rises
- call _writer_ - bearish (wants mkt to fall/remain unchanged); contract not exercised if mkt px falls below SP

#### mkt attitude
- buy = long = hold = open position w/ debit to acct
- sell = short = write = open position w/ credit to acct

### options premiums
- __premium__ = px of options contract
- both bid & ask are quoted in cents
	- min. price interval = `$0.05`
- option buyer pays _ask_/_offer_ px
- option seller receives _bid_ px
- option premium reflects 2 types of values:
	1. intrinsic value (amt by which option is ITM)
	2. time value (mkt's perceived worth of time remaining to expieration)
- options premiums quoted on _per share_ basis

#### factors affecting premium
- volatility, amt of intrinsic value, time remaining until expiration, IRs
- volatility
	- if underlying stock px fell from one day -> next, _call premium would fall_ and _put premium would rise_
	- any change in underlier px affects amt of intrinsic value
- `premium = intrinsic value + time value`
