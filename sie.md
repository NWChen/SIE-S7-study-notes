> preferred stockholder receives 4 shares of common stock for every 1 share of preferred

- callable feature: choice of whether to convert or allow it to be called, depends on relative value of common stock received through conversion (vs. call px)

> e.g. RMO 5% convertible preferred stock will be called at $102/share
> preferred is convertible into 2 shares of common stock, RMO common sells in mkt at $55/share
> px of preferred (after notice appears) will most likely trade in mkt at a price near $110

# debt instruments
## basic bond characteristics
- investor lends money to issuer
- issuer (debtor) promises to repay debt service
- __debt service__ - sum(interest payments over bond's life, final repayment of principal (loan value) at maturity)
- issuer goes into default if any payments are missed
- __leverage financing__ - raising capital through debt (borrowing against issuer's net worth)
	- __leveraged issuer__ - has more debt than equity outstanding

### par value
- amount issuer pays investor at maturity
	- usually multiples of $100 or $1000

### coupon rate
- issuer must pay investors interest on loan until bond matures
- __coupon rate__ - fixed rate of interest of bond
	- based on $1000 par vlaue of bond
- investors purchase bonds to generate income represented by coupon rate
- longer maturity ~= higher coupon
	- investor $ at risk for long period
	- higher rate of return expected
- higher credit risk ~= higher yields 
- __yield__ - return on investment, OR
	- in debt instrument purchased at par value, interest payments

> e.g. 6% corporate bond
> client receives $1000 * 6% = $60
> bonds pay interest semiannually
> investor receives two $30 payments annually

## fixed/variable rates
- __adjustable rate bonds__ - variable/floating rate sxties
	- coupon rate might adjust to reflect mkt conditions

### initial interest payment
- generally, bonds pay interest on 1st and 15th 
- __newly issued__ bonds pay interest from dated date (on which interest begins to accrue)
	- first coupon on a newly issued bond may be for more/less than traditional 6mo period
- __long coupon__ - first coupon for more than 6mo
- __short coupon__ - first coupon for less than 6mo

### accrued interest
- bondholder who sells a bond between interest payments:
	- entitled to interest earned during period when investor still owned the bond
- accrued interest is amount seller entitled to receive (from buyer), and amount buyer required to pay (to seller) for a bond being sold in secondary market
- corporate/muni bonds use 30days/mo, 360 days/year
- US gov. T-notes, T-bonds use actual days/mo, 365 days/yr

### zero-coupon bonds
- don't pay periodic interest
- investor purchases bond at deep discount from par value
	- redeems bond for full face value at maturity (lump sum)
- `interest = amt received at maturity - purchase price`
- longer maturity ~= deeper discount from par value

#### maturity date
- date bondholder receives $1,000 return of principal from issuer
- __term bond issue__ - all bonds in an offering mature on the same date
- __serial bond issue__ - parts of an offering mature sequentially over several years
- __level debt service__ - structuring of serial bond s.t. principal, interest payments represent roughly equal annual payments over life of earning
- __balloon maturity__ - part of offering matures serially, large portion of offering pays off at final maturity

## bond px fluctuation from par
- caused by changes in market IRs (IR risk), or credit risk
- __discount__ - bond sells at less than par value
- __premium__ - bond sells above par value

### interest-rate risk
- bond mkt value may decline if mkt IRs rise
- as market rates increase, investors won't purchase existing bonds at par
	- can obtain higher yields by purchasing new bonds
- existing bonds must be offered at discount to attract purchasers
- if IRs fall after bond issuance, bond will trade at premium to par

### credit risk
- issuer may default, not be able to pay interest/principal to bondholders
- issuers at high credit risk must pay higher IR to get investors to purchase bonds
- risky co. -> falling bond pxs; improving co. -> rising bond pxs

#### measuring credit risk
- govt risk of default is ~0, so US govt sxties have lowest possible credit risk
- Moody's, S&P, Fitch rate bond issue credit; evaluate whether issue may default, assign it a credit rating

### bond pricing
- bond px usually stated as pctage of par value
> e.g. bond w. px=100 sells at 100% of par value
> bond w. px=90 sells at %90 par value = $900
> bond w. px=110 sells at %110 par value = $1100

- or as points: 1pt = 1% of par value
> 99pts = $990
> bond selling at 100 is selling for 100pts = $1000
> bond selling at 101 is selling for 101% par value = $1010

- corp./muni bonds trade in 1/8pt increments
- T-notes/bonds trade in 1/32pt increments

## prices/yields are inversely related
- if IRs rise, value(px) of existing bonds will fall
	- demand for existing bonds (which offer lower IRs) will decline
- if IRs fall, value(px) of existing bonds will rise
	- they're worth more than a new bond issued w/ a lower coupon

### bond yield
- equivalent to return
- nominal yield (coupon), current yield (annual interest/current mkt px), yield-to-maturity (effective return)

## redeeming bonds prior to maturity
- at maturity: bondholder redeems bond to issuer & receives bond par value _plus_ last interest payment
	- then issuer's obligation to bondholder has ended, debt is considered retired

### call provisions
- allows issuer to redeem outstanding bonds before they reach maturity
	- if called, investor receives full return of principal + any accrued interest
- issuers make bonds callable to [be able to] take advantage of declining IRs
	- yields (coupons) of callable bonds (generally) higher than those of non-callable bonds
		- to entice investors to buy
- __call protection__ - period when bonds can't be called (after issuance)
- __call premium__ - issuer pays bondholders more than par value to compensate them for early redemption

#### call types
- __in-whole__ entire issue called at once
- __partial (lottery)__ - some bonds retired early, others still outstanding
- __catastrophe__ - in event of destruction of underlying collateral

#### put provisions
- bondholder can redeem bond on specified date(s) prior to maturity
- yields generally lower (prices higher), since bondholders able to redeems bonds in the event that IRs rise

## convertible bonds
- often issued by corp.s w/ weak credit rating
- investor can convert bond par value into predetermined #shares of co.'s common stock
- convertible issues often have lower coupons than similar non-converts
- if/when converted, bond debt becomes eqeuity; capital structure of issuer changes

### converting bonds to stock
- __conversion ratio__ = (par value of bond ($1000) / conversion price)

> e.g. 10% converts w/ conversion px=$40
> conversion ratio = $1000/$40 = 25 shares/bond

- decision to convert depends on px of underlying stock vs. bond mkt value

> e.g. bond convertible at $40, trading in mkt for 85
> common stock for the same trading at $35/share
> if bond sold in mkt - investor receives 85% of par = $850
> if bond converted into 25 shares (1000/40 = 25), they could be sold for 25x35 = $875
> so investor should convert bond into stock and sell stock

### forced conversion
- most convertible issues are callable
	- issuer can redeem bonds prior to maturity
- call (redemption) px of bond < conversion value -> bondholder may be forced to convert immediately / accept less than its conversion value

> e.g. Rob owns corp. bond convertible at $40
> underlying stock selling at $45/share
> corp. indicates bond will be called at 105 (=$1050) on next call date
> conversion ratio = (par value / conversion px) = ($1000 / $40) = 25 shares/bond
> conversion value = #shares x px/share = 25 shares x $45 = $1125
> Rob should convert bond to stock, since shares are worth $1125 (vs. $1050 at bond call)

### conversion is not taxable
- taxable event arises only when investor sells acquired shares (i.e. after conversion)

# debt instruments
## treasury securities
- __Treasuries__ - securities issued by US govt
	- exempt from registration (like those issued by any govt agency)
- safest type of fixed-income invstmt
- virtually no credit risk
- types
	- marketable (negotiable)
	- non-marketable (non-negotiable)
- marketable instruments
	- T-bills
	- T-notes
	- T-bonds
	- T-STRIPS
	- TIPS (inflation-protected)
	- CMBs (cash mgmt bills)

## T-notes, T-bonds
- interest-bearing sxties
- pay fixed IR semiannually
  - investors receive face value at maturity
- T-notes: 2-10yr maturity
- T-bonds: >10yr maturity
- minimum denominations: $100
  - generally: par value $1000
- interest received on T-notes, T-bonds taxed at federal level
  - exempt from state taxation
  - exempt from local taxation

## Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
- bond investors are mainly concerned with inflation
  - principal takes years to return
  - inflation diminishes purchasing power of returned funds
- __TIPS__: interest-bearing marketable sxties
  - fixed IR
  - principal on which interest paid may vary based on CPI
	- consumer price index
- during inflation, CPI rises; TIPS principal value increases
- during deflation, CPI declines; TIPS principal value decreases (floor at $1000)
- available in 5/10/30-yr terms
- denominated in $100 increments
- interest received taxed at federal, not state/local levels

> e.g. 4% TIPS @ principal $1000
> say inflation, principal adjusts to $1030
> interest for next semiannual payment is fixed IR based on inflation-adjusted principal
> 4% * 1030 = $41.20
> next semiannual payment is $41.20/2 = 20.60

## Non interest-bearing securities
- interest-bearing: T-bonds, T-notes, TIPS

### Treasury bills
- short-term sxties maturing in <=1yr
- available maturities:
  - 1mo (4wks)
  - 3mo (13wks)
  - 6mo (26wks)
  - 1yr (52wks)
- sold in minimum denominations of $100, increments of $100
- sold at discount from face value
- make no semiannual interest payments
- interest = `face value at maturity - purchase price`
  - discount/non-interest-bearing
- quoted on _discounted yield basis_
  - `yield ~= % discount from sxty face value`
- inversely related: price ~= 1/yield 

> bid = 1.12 discount yield
> ask = 1.11 discount yield
> bid (higher yield) represents lower price

- __bond equivalent yield__: compares T-bill yield with other interest-bearing sxties' yield 
  - interest earned is on amt invested, not face amt
  - T-bill bond equivalent yield is always > discount yield

## Stripped securities
### Treasury STRIPS
- Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities
- BDs can purchase T-notes, T-bonds; separately resell coupon, principal payments as zero-coupons (discounted sxties)
  - must first request treatment through a federal reserve bank
- `interest = investor's purchase price - bond's face value`
- quoted on yield basis (not pctage of par value)

### Cash Management Bills (CMBs)
- unscheduled/short-term debt offerings used to smooth out Treasury cash flows
- issued at discount, mature at face amount
- durations as short as 1 day

## US Treasury Sxties Auctions (Primary market)
- Treasuries are sold through US Treasury-conducted auctions
- sxties firms submit bids (competitive tenders)
  - bid = { price/yield at which firm willing to buy }
- individuals submit bids (non-competitive tenders)
  - filled first
  - bidders must agree to accept yield/price as determined by auction
- single price auction process: all auction winners pay lowest price of accepted competitive tenders

## agency securities
- issued/gtd by federal agencies & government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
- not direct obligations of the US govt
  - still low credit risk
- yields lightly higher than those of corresponding US Treasuries
- quoted in 1/32nds of a point

### federal agencies
- direct extensions of US govt
- includes Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA)

### Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
- publicly chartered/privately owned organizations
- provide low-cost loans for certain population segments
- issue sxties through selling group of dealers
  - offering's proceeds provided to bank/other lender
  - bank lends money to individuals seeking financing (homeowners, farmers)
- e.g.:
  - Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCBs)
  - Federal Home Loans Banks (FHLBs)

### Federal Farm Credit Banks - FFCBs
- provide funds for orgs making agricultural loans to farmers
  - banks for cooperatives
  - intermediate credit banks
  - federal land banks
- interest received subject to federal tax, exempt from state/local

### Federal Home Loan Banks - FHLBs
- provide liquidity for savings&loans institutions needing extra funds
  - e.g. for seasonal demand for money
- interest received subject to federal tax, exempt from state/local

## Mortgage-backed securities
- secured by pools of home mortgages
- issued by GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC

### pass-through certificates
- most common sxty issued by govt agencies: mortgage-backed pass-through certificate
- creation:
  - agency purchases pool of mortgages w/ similar IRs, maturities
  - interests in pool sold to investors as pass-through certificates
- 1 cert = undivided interest in pool
  - owners entitled to share in cash flow generated by pooled mortgages
- homeowners make mortgage payments on monthly basis
  - payments passed to investors every month
  - payment includes a portion of both interest & principal

### federal home loan mortgage corporation (FHLMC)
- provides funds to federally insured savings institutions
  - to finance new housing
- raises money for operations through issuing:
  - mortgage-backed bonds
  - pass-through certificates
  - guaranteed mortgage-backed certificates
- backed by other agencies/mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac

- issues MBS, participation certificates, and modified pass-through certificates
- modified pass-through certificate
  - backed by pool of FHA and/or VA residential mortgages
  - mortgage payment = { principal, interest }
	 - portion of payments passes through to investors who purchased GNMA certs
	 - GNMA guarantees monthly payments to cert owners, even if not collected from homeowners
- __prepayment risk__ - average life of mortgages in pool tends to be shorter than 25-30yr maturity, since:
  - IRs may decline
  - prepayments, foreclosures, refinancings

#### prepayment risk
- MBS have usual fixed-income risks:
  - IR risk
  - credit risk
  - liquidity risk
- and _prepayment risk_
  - homeowners may pay off mortgages early
  - when IRs fall, homeowners incentivized to refinance, pay off existing mortgages

## municipal bonds
- issued by US states/territories, public agencies
- some level of default risk
- interest received typically exempt from federal tax

### types of municipal bonds
- general obligation (GO) bonds
	- issued for general purposes
- revenue bonds
	- issued to fund a specific project/facility
	- cash flows generated by specific project are used to repay bondholders

#### general obligation (GO) bonds
- secured by credit/taxing power of issuer
- only issuers able to levy/collect taxes may issue GO bonds
- prior to issuing GO bonds, issuers must obtain voter approval
	- since taxpayer money pays for debt service
- _authority to issue_ - GO bond issuer may be subject to a debt ceiling

#### backing
- state GO bonds usually secured by:
	- income tax, sales tax, gasoline tax, excise tax
- non-tax revenue may also be used to pay debt service on GO bonds

### Revenue bonds
- for either projects/enterprise financings where:
	- issuer pledges to repay bondholders using revenues generated by project/facility
	- or from rental/lease payments revenue
- riskier than GO bonds - generated revenues may be insufficient to fund debt service
- statutory/constitutional debt limitations may prevent municipality from issuing general obligation bonds
	- then revenue bonds may be issued to finance capital projects

### Types of revenue bonds
- housing revenue bonds - issued by state/local housing agencies
- dormitory bonds - issued to build housing for students at public universities; repaid from a portion of students' tuition payments
- health care revenue bonds - issued for construction of non-profit hospitals / healthcare facilities

- industrial development bonds (municipality doesn't back bonds, but issues them for private company's facility)
- taxable municipal bonds - bond may lose tax exemption when:
	- offering in which proceeds of bond used to build sports facility / certain types of housing
	- offering designed to allow issuer to borrow funds to replenish unfunded pension liabilities
- double-barreled bonds
	- backed by specific revenue source (other than property taxes)

## Municipal notes
- short-term issues
	- to finance a project, or
	- assist municipality w/ managing cash flow
- interest-bearing sxties paying interest at maturity
- __tax anticipation notes__ - finance current muni operations in anticipation of future tax receipts from property taxes (GO sxties)
- __revenue anticipation notes__ - issued in anticipation of receiving revenues at a future date (e.g. federal/state subsidies)
- __tax and revenue anticipation notes__ - at TAN & RAN issuance together
- __bond anticipation notes__ - to finance projects eventually financed through sale of long-term bonds
- __grant anticipation notes__ - in expectation of receiving funds (grants) from govt
- __construction loan notes__ - issued by municipalities to provide funds for construction of a project eventually funded by a bond issue

### Municipal notes ratings
- Moody's has four ratings categories:
	- first three: invstmt grade (MIG)
	- fourth: speculative grade

## Other municipal securities
### Auction rate securities
- long-term investments, but IRs/dividends paid are resent at frequent intervals via auctions
- investors purchasing ARSs seek cash-like invstmts paying higher yield than available via money-mkt funds/CDs
- two types:
	- bonds w/ long-term maturities
	- preferred shares w/ cash dividend
- bond IRs & dividend on preferred shares
	- both vary based on rates set through Dutch auctions

### Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDOs)
- IR adjusted at specified intervals
	- adjustments allows owner to sell/put sxty back to issuer/third party on date that a new rate is established
	- then investor receives par value plus accrued interest
- investors interested in short-term invstmts can also purchase other tax-free money mkt instruments
	- e.g. tax-exempt commercial paper, tax-free money mkt funds
		- tax-exempt CP has max maturity 270days; backed by bank line of credit

## Primary market for municipal bonds
- like US govt / govt agency sxties - muni sxties exempt from registration/prospectus requirements of 1933 Sxties Act

## GO bond issuance
- two conditions, since GO bond issues backed by taxes:
	- voter approval
	- debt ceiling limitations

## issuing revenue bonds
- feasibility study - determines whether bond revenue would cover expenses of project, debt service

## new issue underwritings
- muni underwriter links issuer & investing public
	- prices sxties
	- structures financing
	- prepares disclosure document
- underwriters appointed via negotiated sale or competitive sale
	- negotiated - issuer selects lead underwriter
	- competitive - issuer invites underwriters to submit competitive bids (e.g. lowest interest cost over issue life)
- US govt sxties - auction process
- muni GO bonds - competitive sale
- muni revenue bonds - negotiated sale
- corporate bonds - negotiated sale

## Forming a municipal syndicate
- multiple BDs form an underwriting syndicate
	- share issue selling liability/risk

	- corp. gives up no control of co./any portion of its profits

## Types of corporate bonds
### Secured
- if issuer falls into bankruptcy 
	- trustee takes possession of assets, liquidates them, distributes proceeds to bondholders
- if company defaults, secured bondholders have higher degree of protection
- mortgage bonds, equipment trust certificates, collateral trust bonds

#### asset-backed securities (ABS)
- some loans held by financial institutions are not permanently held by lender
- securitized/offered to investors
	- lender sells receivables to trust, who creates sxty which represents interest in trust backed by subject receivables
- subject to IR risk, credit risk, prepayment risk

### Unsecured
- debentures - corp. bonds backed only by corp.'s full faith and credit
	- if issuer defaults, bond owners have same claim on company's assets as any other general creditor
- high-yield (junk) bonds - below investment grade
	- higher-than-normal credit risk (of making timely interest payments/ repaying principal)
	- pay higher coupons to compensate investors for added risk
- guaranteed bonds - secured by guarantee of another corporation

## Other types of corporate bonds
- income bonds - issued by companies in reorganization
	- issuer doesn't promise to pay interest unless it has sufficient earnings

- agrees to repurchase them at a specific time and higher price
- first dealer is borrowing money from second dealer
	- secures loan with securities (collateralized loan)
- in return for making loan, second dealer (lender) receives (resale price of sxties - purchase price)
- _reverse repo_/_matched sale_

# Investment returns
- measuring performance on stock/bond investments

## Return on equity investments
### Dividends
- dividends paid on a per-share basis
- _declaration date_ - date on which dividend authorized
- _payment date_ - date on which declared dividend paid
	- dividends usually paid quarterly, taxable in year paid/received
- _record date_ - date on which investor must own stock to be entitled to receive the dividend

### Ex-dividend rule
- ex-dividend date = date on which stock begins to trade w/o its dividend
> e.g. stock paying $.50 dividend closes at $20/share on day before ex-date
> opens at price of $19.50 on ex-dividend date

### Due bills
- if trade executed prior to ex-dividend date, then buyer entitled to dividend
- cash settle - same date
	- for cash settlement trade; ex-dividend date is business day following record date
- co. can also pay dividends in stock, instead of cash
> e.g. investors buys 100shares $WXYZ for $80/share
> cost basis = $8000
> $WXYZ declares a 10% stock dividend
> investor entitled to addtl 10 shares (100 x 10%)
> stock dividends not taxable until sold
> investors holds an increased #shares at reduced px/share
> IRS requires investor to adjust cost basis:
> original = $80/share ($8000/100 original shares)
> adjusted = $72.72/share ($8000/110 original shares)

### Current/dividend yield
- annualized dividend / current mkt px
> e.g. $XYZ trading at $50/share
> $XYZ pays quarterly dividend of $0.25
> current yield is $2%

## Return on bond investments
- dollar amount of interest paid by band annually = coupon rate x par value

## Prices and yields
- as IRs rise, value (px) of existing bonds falls
	- demand for existing bonds offering lower IRs declines

### Calculating bond yields
#### nominal yield
- equal to coupon rate, regardless of price paid
	- ignores fact that bond may have been purchased at premium/discount

#### current yield
- based on bond's current mkt price 
- measures what a bond investor receives each year based on (potential) purchase price
- `current yield = (annual interest / current market price)`
- nominal yield is fixed

> price paid = $900 (discount)
> annual interest $100
> current yield = $100 / $900
> = 11.11%

#### yield-to-maturity
- takes into account everything an investor receives on a bond from time of purchase until maturity
- _basis_ = _yield_ = _yield to maturity_
- price < nominal yield < current yield < yield to maturity
- if an investor purchases a bond at par:
	- nominal yield = current yield = yield-to-maturity
- if an investor purchases a bond at discount:
	- nominal yield < current yield < yield-to-maturity
- if an investor purchases a bond at premium:
	- yield-to-maturity < current yield < nominal yield

### call provisions
- allows issuer to redeem/call outstanding bonds before they reach their final maturity
- if called, issuer must pay bondholders more than par value to compensate them for early bond redemption
	- call premium - additional amount 
- investor receives more than par, and prior to bond's expected maturity

### yield-to-call
- bond yield if called prior to maturity
- yield-to-worst = min(yield-to-call, yield-to-maturity)
- if bond trading at discount:
	- YTM < YTC
- if bond trading at premium (callable at par):
	- YTC < YTM

## cost basis/capital events/return of capitalA
- unrealized capital gains/losses have no impact on tax situation
- __cost basis__ - total amount an investor paid to purchase a sxty
	- includes commissions, fees
	- on reinvestment of sxty distributions, total cost basis of investor increases (must pay tax on distribution)
- __capital gains__ - when invstmt sold for greater value than cost basis
	- short-term: held <=1yr, taxed at marginal (ordinary income) tax rate
	- long-term: held >=1yr, taxed at min(long-term, 20%)
- __capital losses__ - generated when ivnstmt sold for lower value than cost basis
- __return of capital__ - when investor receives portion of original invstmt back
	- not a taxable event
	- any return of capital lowers cost basis (now has less money at risk)

## measuring return
### total return
- total return = ((ending value - beginning value) + investment income) / (beginning value)
> e.g. purchase 1000 shares $VPN at $25/share
> $VPN pays $0.80 annual dividend
> after 1yr, $VPN mkt value declines to $23/share
> total return = ((23k - 25k) + 800)/25k = -4.8%

### inflation-adjusted
- inflation-adjusted RoR = actual return - rate of inflation
> $ABC bond has nominal yield of 8%
> rate of inflation = 3%
> inflation-adjusted return = 8% - 3% = 5%

### risk-free return
- return on an investment with no risk
- e.g. T-bill or 10yr treasury

### risk-adjusted return
- return of invesmtent wrt risk assumed to attain it

## averages/indexes
### dow jones
- Dow Jones Composite Average
- 65 stocks
- DJIndustrialA (30), DJTranspotationA (20), DJUtilityA (15)

	- not required to be given to any person interested in purchasing shares

### mutual fund structure
- BoD
- invstmt adviser - paid mgmt fee based on AUM not performance
- custodian bank - maintains assets, collects dividends/interest from them
- transfer agent - recordkeeping, issuing new shares, redemptions
- principal underwriter (wholesaler/distributor) to sell shares to public

#### distribution methods
1. fund -> principal underwriter -> { ... dealers ... } -> investors
2. fund -> principal underwriter -> investors
3. fund -> investors

#### categories of mutual funds
- aggressive growth - invest in small companies
	- participate in IPOs of their shares
- growth - capital appreciation
	- above-average growth in share price
- specialized/sector
- international/global
- equity income
	- high dividends wrt mkt pxs
	- mature co.s w/ less potential for capital appreciation, but less likely to decline in value than growth co.s
- growth/income - both capital appreciation and current income
- bond funds - current income, preservation of capital
	- bonds only
	- credit/call/reinvestment/IR risk (same as bonds)
- index funds
	- passively managed, so lower mgmt fees
- value funds - undervalued/restructuring co.s - for long time horizons
- balanced funds - across stocks, bonds, money mkt (cash equiv)
- asset allocation - like balanced, but fund managers determine pctage of fund assets to invest in each category based on mkt conditions
- money mkt funds - short-term debt (money mkt) instruments

## buying/selling mutual fund shares
- purchased at Public Offering Price - POP
- redeemed/sold at intrinsic NAV
- sales charge = (POP - NAV)
- client redeeming/selling shares receives next calculated NAV

## NAV and charges 
- NAV = (total net assets) / (# outstanding shares)
- total net assets = (current mkt px + cash - total liabilities)
- _forward pricing_ - orders to buy/sell are computed at next computed px
- _settlement of transactions_ - mut fund transactions settle same-day as purchase/redemption
	- ex-dividend date determined by fund/principal underwriter
	- usually day after record date
- _sales charge_ = (POP - NAV) / POP
- _backend loads, contingent deferred sales charges_ - investors can buy @ NAV, mut fund assesses sales charge when investors redeem
	- decreasing charge as investor owns shares longer
	- CDSC - there may be no sales charge at redemption if investor holds shares long enough
- _no-load_ - mutual fund with no sales charge, POP = NAV
	- front-end load must be below 25bps (.25%) of average annual fund NAV

## fees and charges
- 12b1 - mut funds pay for distribution expenses through deductions from portfolio assets
	- maximum fee: annualized 1% of fund assets
- service fees - charges deducted under 12b1, pay for personal svcs/shareholder acct maintenance
	- e.g. trailer - trailing commission fee paid to RR
- administrative, e.g. payments to custodians/transfer agents
- fee disclosure
- expense ratio = (total expenses) / (average net assets) 
	- no-load funds have low expense ratios

## classes of shares
- _class A_ - small 12b1 fees
	- disadvantage - not all investor's money directed in portfolio
- _class B_ - no up-front sales charges, higher 12b1s
	- CDSC applies if shares redeemed before certain period
- _class C_ - assess up-front sales charge, and 12b1 fee ~= 1% of fund's assets
	- investor may also pay CDSC if shares sold within 12-18mo after being purchased

## reducing sales charges
- for class A shares:
- _sales breakpoint_ - reduced sales charge, e.g. when large sum of money invested with one fund family
- _breakpoints_ - level at which sales charge is reduced (volume discount)
- _adjusted POP_ - fund offering px based on reduced sales charge pctage
	- _POP_ = (NAV) / (100% - sales charge %)

> e.g. XYZ fund has NAV=$10
> person invests $100,000 into fund
> entitled to 3.25% breakpoint
> adjusted offering px = ($10) / (100% - 3.25%) = $10.34
> investor can purchase $100k/$10.34 = 9671.18 shares

- _letter of intent_ - qualifies investor for a discount made available through discounts, w/o initially depositing entire required amount	- non-binding
- _rights of accumulation_ - investor can receive cumulative quantity discounts when purchasing mutual fund shares
	- reduced sales charge based on total invstmt within family of funds
- fund must offer both breakpoints and RoA to assess max sales charge of 8.5%
- funds usually allow investors to reinvest dividends/other distirbutions at NAV w/o paying sales charge

## dollar cost averaging (DCA)
- buy more shares when px low; fewer shares when px high
- redemption - shares redeemed at NAV
	- redemption feeds of .5% to 2%

## systematic withdrawal plans
- investors receive regular payments on monthly/quarterly basis
	- payments from dividends, then capital gains
- fixed-dollar, fixed-pctage, or fixed-time options

## prohibited sales practices
- breakpoint sales
- no discounts on class B shares - only class As qualify for breakpoints
- switching shares - mvmt b/w different fund families results in a new sales charge
- exchanging shares - no sales practice issue
	- IRS considers this sale of one fund's shares, purchase of another fund's shares

## other types of invstmt co.s
### face-amount certificate companies
- issues debt certs that pay a predetermined rate of interest
	- _surrender value_ - lesser amt received if certs cashed in early

### unit investment trusts
- formed under _indenture_
- _trustees_, not BoD
- invest in fixed portfolio of income-producing sxties (bonds/preferreds)
- only issue redeemable sxties - shares of SBIs
	- sold in minimum denominations of $1k
- SBIs transactable on secondary mkt
	- 1 unit = 1 undivided interest in UIT portfolio
- supervised, but not managed, invstmt co.s
	- no mgmt fees

# Alternative Investments
## ETFs
- interest in underlying basket of sxties mirroring an index
- passive: track index, match market
- active: select sxties in portfolio by professional manager

### Fee Considerations
- passive mgmt fees are lower than cost of active mgmt
	- purchasers of ETF shares pay commissions (not sales charges, like on mutual fund shares)
- lower expenses than mutual funds
- shares may be sold short and purchased on margin

### Short-term ETF variations
- reset portfolios daily to meet objectives
	- may not provide true tracking of underlying index/benchmark over longer periods
- inverse ETFs - increase in value when mkt drops, decrease when mkt rises
	- often used by investors with long positions as a hedge against a bear mkt
- leveraged ETFs - provide investors with multiple of return of benchmark index
	- using debt instruments/derivatives

## Exchange-traded notes (ETNs)
- unsecured debt sxty
	- pays return linked to underlying mkt index/benchmark
- don't make interest payments
	- pay holder amt based on performance of underlying index/benchmark
	- maturities 10->30yrs
- issuer credit risk
	- created by bank; are unsecured debt obligations of issuer
	- risk of credit quality of issuer

### Fee Considerations
- _indicative value_ - reference value of benchmark minus daily investor fee
- brokerage commissions that investors may pay when buying/selling ETNs

## Hedge funds
- private investment pool - don't have to register with SEC
	- often sold under Reg D (private placement) exemption
- illiquid
	- don't have to publish NAV daily
	- can impose withdrawal restrictions
	- offer investors limited partnership units 
- potential use of leverage
- high minimum initial invstmt requirements
- unregulated, more complex
- compensation
	- mutual funds must assess sales charge <=8.5% of fund's POP
	- hedge funds often do 2% management, 20% of profits

## Private equity funds
- unregulated and illiquid
- like hedge funds, not generally available to accredited investors

## Real estate investment trusts (REITs)
### Regulation
- securities act of 1933 regulates REITs as securities
	- prospectuses must bes ent to investors who purchase shares offered to public in primary mkt

### Investment attributes 
- income received from tenant rent 
	- tenant leases real estate owned by the REIT
- mortgage
	- earn income from IR spread b/w mortgages & borrowed funds
- equity
	- own & operate income-producing real estate
- hybrid
	- both mortgage and equity

### Liquidity
- Reg D - private placements unregistered w/ SEC
	- illiquid, difficult to price
- registered & listed (exchange-traded each business day)
	- reported on customer acct statements at their current mkt value/share
- registered & unlisted
	- reported on customer statements at estimated mkt value/share

### Tax treatment
- no double taxation on dividends REIT pays to shareholders
	- income only taxed once (at investors' levels)
- unlike DPPs, REITs don't pass-through operating losses
- special tax treatment: satisfiable by three income tests:
	- >=95% of gross income derived from dividends/interest/rents from real property
	- >=75% of gross income derived from real property income (rents/interest/etc.)
	- <=30% of gross income derived from sale/disposition of stock/sxties held for <12mo
- investors get stable dividend, taxed as ordinary income deductible from tax
	- 90% distribution on taxable income

### Direct participation programs (DPPs)
- results of business venture directly flow through to investors
	- cash flow, profits, losses
- limited partnership:
	- minimum of 2 partners (general partner, >=1 limited partner)
	- GP manages program, contribuets at least 1% of capital
	- LP is passive, contributes large amount of capital

#### advantages
- favorable tax treatment - income/loss allocated directly to partners
- passive income distributed is taxed as ordinary income
- business pays no tax
- LPs receive more income (possibly) than from a profitable corporation (since those dividends are paid as after-tax distributions)
	- 20% of income passed through partnership is deductible (excluded from tax)
- limited liability (cannot lose more than amount they have at risk)
- diversification (invest in assets w/ little/no correlation to stock/bond mkts)

#### disadvantages
- lack of control (for LPs)
- illiquidity
- tax issues
- possible capital call

#### general partners
- have unlimited liability
- fiduciary relationship to LPs in programs

### limited partners
- don't take active role in management of programs
	- can lend to partnership, inspect books, compete

### offering and tax treatment
- public/private offering
	- public: GP hires underwriter/syndicator to mkt program to public, register DPP's interest w/ SEC
		- still unlisted/illiquid
		- max underwriting compensation for public offering is 10% of gross dollar amount of sxties being sold
	- private: Reg D (under Securities Act of 1933), exempt from registration
- passive activities - invstmts in DPPs, rental activities
	- losses generated by passive activities may only be deducted against income from passive activities

## Types of Limited Partnerships
### Real estate
- land is a commodity with fixed supply, increasing demand
	- raw land - no depreciation deductions, no periodic income, capital appreciation after selling property
	- new construction - capital appreciation or cash flow from rent (leasing to tenants)
- existing properties - predictable, certain returns 
	- benefits - cash flow from rentals, depreciation allowances available
- government-assisted housing
	- most federally subsidized housing programs are part of Section 8, administered by govt agency HUD
	- costs for construction/rehabilitation/acquisition of low-income housing qualify for tax credits

### Oil and gas
- exploratory - high-risk
- developmental - leases in proven areas
	- high deductibility
	- lower risk, lower potential return
- balanced
	- both exploratory and developmental
- income
	- acquires interest in existing producing wells
	- for risk-averse

# Options
- derivative sxty - contract whose value derived from mvmt of underlying stock/index/currency/asset
- _long_ - buyer/owner/holder of option
	- pays premium (contract's mkt px)
	- has right to exercise
	- max loss = premium paid (when option expires worthless)
- _short_ - writer/seller of option
	- receives premium
	- assumes obligation if contract exercised
	- max gain = premium received (when option expires worthless)

## types of options
### call
- owner has right to buy underlier
	- call buyer can _call_ sxty away from writer at fixed px
- call writer is obligated to sell sxty at fixed px if owner exercises
	- call buyer is bullish on underlier
	- call seller is bearish on underlier

### put
- owner has right to sell underlier
	- put buyer can _put_ security to writer at fixed px
- put writer is obligated to buy sxty at fixed px if owner exercises
	- put buyer is bearish on underlier
	- put seller is bullish on underlier

### contract components
- underlier; contract expiration; exercise/strike px; type
> e.g. long 1 call option on $XYZ w/ May expiration, exercise px=$30, premium=3
- 1 equity option = right to buy/sell 100shares (1 round lot) of underlying stock
- expiration month - if option not exercised/liquidated prior to expiration, it ceases to exist (expires)
- exercise/strike price - px at which call owner may buy stock from writer, or put owner may sell stock to writer
- premium - 3pts = $3/share; for 100 shares, purchase px = $300
	- amount buyer pays to sellr for rights conveyed by contract

### premium
- px determined in secondary mkt
- vary with changes in prices of underlying sxties
- influenced by:
	- mkt px of underlier vs. strike px of option contract
	- time remaining until option expiration
	- volatility of underlier

### intrinsic value
- `option premium = intrinsic value + time value`
- call moneyness
	- ITM - stock mkt px > option strike px
	- ATM - stock mkt px = option strike px
	- OTM - stock mkt px < option strike px
- put moneyness
	- ITM - stock mkt px < option strike px
	- ATM - stock mkt px = option strike px
	- OTM - stock mkt px > option strike px
- intrinsic value >= 0
	- ITM - IV > 0
	- ATM - IV = 0
	- OTM - IV = 0
- buyers prefer options to gain IV (they own assets; want them to increase in value)
- writers prefer options to lose IV - moneyness represents potential obligation if contract exercised
	- exercise = assigned to writer

### time value
- only ITM options have IV
- ATM/OTM options only have time value (component of premium)
- ITM options
	- `time value = premium - intrinsic value`

> $XYZ May 30 call has premium=3; $XYZ at $32/share
> premium = (32-30)pts IV + 1pt TV = 3pts
> IV > 0, option is ITM

> $XYZ May 30 call has premium=3; $XYZ at $30/share
> premium = 0pts IV + 3pts TV
> IV = 0, 30call option = $30 mkt px, option is ATM

> ($XYZ Aug 30 call) trades at higher premium than ($XYZ May 30 call)
> Aug option has more life remaining
> TV scales with time; at expiration, TV = 0

## breakeven
- _breakeven pt_ - px at which stock must be trading s.t. investor neither makes/loses money
- _call UP, put DOWN_
	- for calls - breakeven = (strike px + premium)
	- for puts - breakeven = (strike px - premium)
- for options buyer: breakeven = amt underlying stock must move for buyer to recapture premium paid

	- call buyer breakeven = strike px + premium
	> buy $XYZ May 50 call at 5
	> breakeven = $XYZ at $55

	- put buyer breakeven = strike px - premium
	> buy $XYZ May 45 put at 4
	> breakeven = $XYZ at $41

- for options seller: breakeven = amt seller can afford underlier to move, because they received the premium

	- call seller breakeven = strike px + premium
	> sell $XYZ May 50 call at 5
	> breakeven = $XYZ at 55

	- put seller breakeven = strike px - premium
	> buy $XYZ May 45 put at 4
	> breakeven = $XYZ at 41

### speculation vs. hedging
- _speculation_ - generating profit based on anticipated price change in sxty value (on which investor has no existing position)
	- e.g. buying call in anticipation of underlier px increase
	- e.g. buying put in anticipation of underlier px decrease
	- e.g. writing call/put in anticipation that option will expire worthless
- _hedging_ - purchasing options to protect against risk of adverse movement in underlier value
	- investor who owns stock can buy put option to hedge risk of stock decline
		- put purchase locks in sales px (= strike px) if underlier falls in value

## options events
### liquidation (trade/close-out)
- alternative to exercise
- investor (buyer/seller) executes opposite transaction on same contract
> e.g. investor buys (opens) `$XYZ May 30 call at 3`
> $XYZ increases to $40
> investor liquidates position (closes) for adjusted premium of 11 (=10pts IV + 1pt TV)
> investor originally paid $300
> sold for $1100
> gain = $800

### exercise
- american style - exerciseable any time up to expiry day
	- used by all listed equity options
- european style - exerciseable only at specified point in time, usually on day of expiration
	- used by index/currency options

> long `$XYZ May 30` call
> underlier trading at $38/share
> call holder can exercise option & buy stock at strike px=$30/share
> investor can sell stock in mkt at $38/share
> gain = $8/share

> long `$XYZ May 30` put
> underlier trading at $22/share
> investor can buy stock in secondary mkt at $22/share, sell at strike px of $30
> gain = ($30 - $22) = $8/share

### buyer's exercise/writer's assignment
1. investor decides to exercise; notifies BD
2. BD notifies OCC
3. OCC receives exercise instructions from purchaser's BD, randomly issues exercise notice to BD whose account shows a short option position identical to long option position being exercised
4. BD receives exercise notice, selects client to whom notice is assigned
	- FIFO, random selection, or other fair/equitable method
- settlement of options trades occurs in (T+1)
- settlement of exercised option occurs in (T+2)
	- involves purchase and sale of underlying stock

### expiration
- ATM/OTM option on expiry date - holder of contract has no incentive to exercise
- contract expires worthless
- expiration triggers max profit for call/put seller
	- = premium initially received
- expiration triggers max loss for call/put buyer
	- = premium paid

## OCC
- guarantees all listed options
	- protects options investors from counterparty risk

### index options
- equity options: exercise settlement = delivery of underlier
- index options: exercise settlement = receipt/delivery of cash
- index option seller must deliver cash to buyer
	- cash = amt by which option is ITM
	- = `contract strike px - index value`

## hedging with options
- investor long stock, fears stock will decline
	- buy put option on stock -> creates long hedge
	- put will gain value as stock declines
	- loss on stock offset by gain on put
	- breakeven - stock must rise by amt = (stock purchase px + premium paid)
- investor short stock, fears stock will rise
	- buy call option on stock -> creates short hedge
	- call will gain value as stock rises
	- loss on stock offset by gain on call
	- breakeven - stock must decline by amt = `short sale proceeds - premium paid`

## covered/uncovered positions
- wrt seller of option position
- firm margin dept must verify that a client who writes option is in a position to:
	- deliver sxties (if short a call)
	- deliver cash (if short a put)

### covered call
- call seller is obligated to sell(deliver) underlying stock if:
	- buyer of call exercises the contract
- call is covered iff seller owns underlier
> investor long $XYZ, has written (is short) an $XYZ call option
> anticipates $XYZ mkt px will not rise above strike px prior to expiration
> hopes option will expire worthless
> if contract expires, investor generates income from premium received + any potential cash dividend paid on stock
> breakeven - investor can afford stock declining by amt = premium received = `stock purchase px - premium received`

### uncovered call
- investor selling $XYZ call but not owning $XYZ stock - uncovered call
- uncovered call writer has unlimited max potential loss (no limit as to how high sxty px may rise)
- investor effectively short stock (doesn't own deliverable if contract assigned)
- risky position
	- only can be created in a margin acct

### covered put
- seller of a put obligated to buy underlier if put buyer exercises contract
- for put to be covered:
	- seller must be short underlier OR deposit cash equal to strike px
- if investor sells $XYZ put, but doesn't deposit sufficient cash, put is _uncovered_

## P&L potential for various positions
- long call - unlimited profit, limited loss
- long put - limited profit, limited loss
- short call (uncovered) - limited profit, unlimited loss
- short put (uncovered) - limited profit, limited loss
- covered call - limited profit, limited loss
