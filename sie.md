> preferred stockholder receives 4 shares of common stock for every 1 share of preferred

- callable feature: choice of whether to convert or allow it to be called, depends on relative value of common stock received through conversion (vs. call px)

> e.g. RMO 5% convertible preferred stock will be called at $102/share
> preferred is convertible into 2 shares of common stock, RMO common sells in mkt at $55/share
> px of preferred (after notice appears) will most likely trade in mkt at a price near $110
> mkt px of preferred stock reflects increased value of common stock (=conversion value = px per common share * conversion ratio)

# debt instruments
## basic bond characteristics
- investor lends money to issuer
- issuer (debtor) promises to repay debt service
- __debt service__ - sum(interest payments over bond's life, final repayment of principal (loan value) at maturity)
- issuer goes into default if any payments are missed
- __leverage financing__ - raising capital through debt (borrowing against issuer's net worth)
	- __leveraged issuer__ - has more debt than equity outstanding

### par value
- amount issuer pays investor at maturity
	- usually multiples of $100 or $1000

### coupon rate
- issuer must pay investors interest on loan until bond matures
- __coupon rate__ - fixed rate of interest of bond
	- based on $1000 par vlaue of bond
- investors purchase bonds to generate income represented by coupon rate
- longer maturity ~= higher coupon
	- investor $ at risk for long period
	- higher rate of return expected
- higher credit risk ~= higher yields 
- __yield__ - return on investment, OR
	- in debt instrument purchased at par value, interest payments

> e.g. 6% corporate bond
> client receives $1000 * 6% = $60
> bonds pay interest semiannually
> investor receives two $30 payments annually

## fixed/variable rates
- __adjustable rate bonds__ - variable/floating rate sxties
	- coupon rate might adjust to reflect mkt conditions

### initial interest payment
- generally, bonds pay interest on 1st and 15th 
- __newly issued__ bonds pay interest from dated date (on which interest begins to accrue)
	- first coupon on a newly issued bond may be for more/less than traditional 6mo period
- __long coupon__ - first coupon for more than 6mo
- __short coupon__ - first coupon for less than 6mo

### accrued interest
- bondholder who sells a bond between interest payments:
	- entitled to interest earned during period when investor still owned the bond
- accrued interest is amount seller entitled to receive (from buyer), and amount buyer required to pay (to seller) for a bond being sold in secondary market
- corporate/muni bonds use 30days/mo, 360 days/year
- US gov. T-notes, T-bonds use actual days/mo, 365 days/yr

### zero-coupon bonds
- don't pay periodic interest
- investor purchases bond at deep discount from par value
	- redeems bond for full face value at maturity (lump sum)
- `interest = amt received at maturity - purchase price`
- longer maturity ~= deeper discount from par value

#### maturity date
- date bondholder receives $1,000 return of principal from issuer
- __term bond issue__ - all bonds in an offering mature on the same date
- __serial bond issue__ - parts of an offering mature sequentially over several years
- __level debt service__ - structuring of serial bond s.t. principal, interest payments represent roughly equal annual payments over life of earning
- __balloon maturity__ - part of offering matures serially, large portion of offering pays off at final maturity

## bond px fluctuation from par
- caused by changes in market IRs (IR risk), or credit risk
- __discount__ - bond sells at less than par value
- __premium__ - bond sells above par value

### interest-rate risk
- bond mkt value may decline if mkt IRs rise
- as market rates increase, investors won't purchase existing bonds at par
	- can obtain higher yields by purchasing new bonds
- existing bonds must be offered at discount to attract purchasers
- if IRs fall after bond issuance, bond will trade at premium to par

### credit risk
- issuer may default, not be able to pay interest/principal to bondholders
- issuers at high credit risk must pay higher IR to get investors to purchase bonds
- risky co. -> falling bond pxs; improving co. -> rising bond pxs

#### measuring credit risk
- govt risk of default is ~0, so US govt sxties have lowest possible credit risk
- Moody's, S&P, Fitch rate bond issue credit; evaluate whether issue may default, assign it a credit rating

### bond pricing
- bond px usually stated as pctage of par value
> e.g. bond w. px=100 sells at 100% of par value
> bond w. px=90 sells at %90 par value = $900
> bond w. px=110 sells at %110 par value = $1100

- or as points: 1pt = 1% of par value
> 99pts = $990
> bond selling at 100 is selling for 100pts = $1000
> bond selling at 101 is selling for 101% par value = $1010

- corp./muni bonds trade in 1/8pt increments
- T-notes/bonds trade in 1/32pt increments

## prices/yields are inversely related
- if IRs rise, value(px) of existing bonds will fall
	- demand for existing bonds (which offer lower IRs) will decline
- if IRs fall, value(px) of existing bonds will rise
	- they're worth more than a new bond issued w/ a lower coupon

### bond yield
- equivalent to return
- nominal yield (coupon), current yield (annual interest/current mkt px), yield-to-maturity (effective return)

## redeeming bonds prior to maturity
- at maturity: bondholder redeems bond to issuer & receives bond par value _plus_ last interest payment
	- then issuer's obligation to bondholder has ended, debt is considered retired

### call provisions
- allows issuer to redeem outstanding bonds before they reach maturity
	- if called, investor receives full return of principal + any accrued interest
- issuers make bonds callable to [be able to] take advantage of declining IRs
	- yields (coupons) of callable bonds (generally) higher than those of non-callable bonds
		- to entice investors to buy
- __call protection__ - period when bonds can't be called (after issuance)
- __call premium__ - issuer pays bondholders more than par value to compensate them for early redemption

#### call types
- __in-whole__ entire issue called at once
- __partial (lottery)__ - some bonds retired early, others still outstanding
- __catastrophe__ - in event of destruction of underlying collateral

#### put provisions
- bondholder can redeem bond on specified date(s) prior to maturity
- yields generally lower (prices higher), since bondholders able to redeems bonds in the event that IRs rise

## convertible bonds
- often issued by corp.s w/ weak credit rating
- investor can convert bond par value into predetermined #shares of co.'s common stock
- convertible issues often have lower coupons than similar non-converts
- if/when converted, bond debt becomes eqeuity; capital structure of issuer changes

### converting bonds to stock
- __conversion ratio__ = (par value of bond ($1000) / conversion price)

> e.g. 10% converts w/ conversion px=$40
> conversion ratio = $1000/$40 = 25 shares/bond

- decision to convert depends on px of underlying stock vs. bond mkt value

> e.g. bond convertible at $40, trading in mkt for 85
> common stock for the same trading at $35/share
> if bond sold in mkt - investor receives 85% of par = $850
> if bond converted into 25 shares (1000/40 = 25), they could be sold for 25x35 = $875
> so investor should convert bond into stock and sell stock

### forced conversion
- most convertible issues are callable
	- issuer can redeem bonds prior to maturity
- call (redemption) px of bond < conversion value -> bondholder may be forced to convert immediately / accept less than its conversion value

> e.g. Rob owns corp. bond convertible at $40
> underlying stock selling at $45/share
> corp. indicates bond will be called at 105 (=$1050) on next call date
> conversion ratio = (par value / conversion px) = ($1000 / $40) = 25 shares/bond
> conversion value = #shares x px/share = 25 shares x $45 = $1125
> Rob should convert bond to stock, since shares are worth $1125 (vs. $1050 at bond call)

### conversion is not taxable
- taxable event arises only when investor sells acquired shares (i.e. after conversion)
